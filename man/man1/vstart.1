.SH NAME
vstart \- start a new netkit virtual machine
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBvstart\fR [options] \fIMACHINE\-NAME\fR


\" ########################################

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIvstart\fR command can be used to start a new virtual machine named
\fIMACHINE\-NAME\fR. Names of virtual machines must be unique for each user.
Yet, different users can run machines having the same name.
.PP
Without providing options, \fIvstart\fR starts a virtual machine whose configuration
reflects the defaults stored inside the \fInetkit.conf\fR file
(see \fBnetkit.conf\fR(5)). The options described below can be used to adjust the
features of a virtual machine upon starting it.
.PP
Notice: unless differently stated, command line arguments (\fIMACHINE\-NAME\fR),
option arguments (e.g., names of collision domains), and any path name (including
the path to the current directory at the time of invoking \fIvstart\fR) should
not contain space characters. Not complying to this causes \fIvstart\fR to raise an error.


.SS Hardware/Kernel settings
.TP
.B
-k \fIFILENAME\fR
.PD 0
.TP
.B
--kernel=\fIFILENAME\fR
Each virtual machine can have its own kernel. By using this option, it is possible
to explicitly choose which kernel should be used for the machine being started.
\fIFILENAME\fR must be a UML kernel. The default kernel is configured inside the
\fInetkit.conf\fR file (see \fBnetkit.conf\fR(5)).

.TP
.B
-M \fIMEMORY\fR
.PD 0
.TP
.B
--mem=\fIMEMORY\fR
Set the amount of available RAM inside the virtual machine to \fIMEMORY\fR MB. The
range of valid amounts and the default amount of memory are both defined inside
the \fInetkit.conf\fR file (see \fBnetkit.conf\fR(5)). Notice that the memory
consumed by the virtual machine processes on the host machine can be slightly
larger than this value.


.SS Networking settings
.TP
.B
--eth\fIN\fR=\fIDOMAIN\fR
Equip virtual machine with a network interface \fBeth\fIN\fR. \fIN\fR is an integer
ranging from 0 to a maximum value stored inside the \fInetkit.conf\fR file
(see \fBnetkit.conf\fR(5)).

Interface \fBeth\fIN\fR will be attached to a (virtual) collision domain whose name
is \fIDOMAIN\fR. A collision domain can be seen as a sort of virtual hub. Thus,
attaching interfaces of different virtual machines to the same
collision domain allows them to exchange network traffic. \fIDOMAIN\fR must not
contain underscores (`\fB_\fR'), commas (`\fB,\fR') and dots (`\fB.\fR'), unless
a ``\fBtap\fR'' collision domain is being configured (see below).

The special domain name ``\fBtap\fR'' is reserved. When attaching an interface
to a ``\fBtap\fR'' domain, an external (i.e., real) network can be reached
through this interface. A ``\fBtap\fR'' collision domain must be declared with
the following syntax:

.nf
--eth\fIN\fR=tap,\fITAP\-ADDRESS\fR,\fIGUEST\-ADDRESS\fR
.fi
                        
where \fITAP\-ADDRESS\fR is the IP address of the host side of the interface
and \fIGUEST\-ADDRESS\fR is the IP address of the interface inside the virtual
machine (guest side). \fITAP\-ADDRESS\fR and \fIGUEST\-ADDRESS\fR must be on
the same (sub)network and, most important, this network must \fInot\fR already
exist on your host network (otherwise routing would be messed up). Interfaces
connected to a ``\fBtap\fR'' collision domain are automatically configured and
brought up inside virtual machines.

There can be at most one ``\fBtap\fR'' collision domain for each user. Hence,
if different virtual machines are configured for using ``\fBtap\fR'' connected
interfaces, they also are on the same collision domain. \fITAP\-ADDRESS\fR is
mandatory, but is only taken into account when a ``\fBtap\fR'' collision domain
is first used (i.e., this is the first interface the current user ever connected
to a ``\fBtap\fR'' collision domain). Otherwise, it simply ignored.

.B
*** IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT USING ``tap'' COLLISION DOMAINS ***
.RS
.IP \(en 2
Configuring ``\fBtap\fR'' domains for the first time requires administrative
(root) privileges. The \fIvstart\fR script will take care of asking you for the
root password if needed. For more information about how Netkit gains root
privileges, see \fBUSE_SUDO\fR and \fBSETTING UP NETKIT FOR USE WITH SUDO\fR in
the man page of \fBnetkit.conf\fR(5). The following operations are performed
when working as root:

1) The `/dev/net/tun' device is created (if it does not exist).
.br
2) Permissions for the `/dev/net/tun' device are set to 666 (read/write for all users).
.br
3) Any existing network device named `nk_tap_\fIUSERNAME\fR' is brought down and
removed (\fIUSERNAME\fR is the name of the current user).
.br
4) A tap network device named `nk_tap_\fIUSERNAME\fR' is created and configured to
have IP address \fITAP\-ADDRESS\fR.
.br
5) Kernel based IP forwarding is enabled via the `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward'
special file.
.br
6) If the iptables firewall is found, packet forwarding for data coming from the
tap interface is enabled. Also, masquerading is enabled. More precisely, the following
rules are added to the current iptables configuration:

*nat
.br
-A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE
.br
*filter
.br
-A FORWARD -i nk_tap_+ -j ACCEPT

All these configuration settings can be easily removed by using the \fBvclean\fR
command (see \fBvclean\fR(1)).

.IP \(en 2
Using ``\fBtap\fR'' domains requires some host-side configurations. These
configurations are not automatically removed after halting virtual machines.
The \fBvclean\fR command must be used for this purpose (see \fBvclean\fR(1)).

.SS Filesystem settings
.TP
.B
-H
.PD 0
.TP
.B
--no-hosthome
By default, the home directory of the current user is made available for
reading/writing inside the virtual machine under the special directory
`/hosthome'. This option disables this behaviour, thus not making the host
filesystem accessible from inside the virtual machine.

.TP
.B
-m \fIMODEL\-FILESYSTEM\fR
.PD 0
.TP
.B
--model-fs=\fIMODEL\-FILESYSTEM\fR
.PD 0
.TP
.B
-f \fIFILESYSTEM\fR
.PD 0
.TP
.B
--filesystem=\fIFILESYSTEM\fR
Virtual machines need two special files which contain their filesystem.

.RS
.IP \(en 2
The whole filesystem of the virtual machine is stored inside a \fImodel file\fR
(also called \fIbacking file\fR). Upon first startup, every virtual machine has
the same filesystem, which is the one stored in the \fImodel file\fR.
.br
The default name of this file is stored inside the file \fInetkit.conf\fR
(see \fBnetkit.conf\fR(5)). By explicitly specifying a \fIMODEL\-FILESYSTEM\fR,
a different model file can be used. \fIMODEL\-FILESYSTEM\fR is the name of a file
that stores an entire model filesystem for the virtual machines.

.IP \(en 2
Changes being made to the model filesystem are stored in a different file, based
on a \fICOW\fR (\fICopy on Write\fR) strategy: whatever is written to the filesystem
is stored in an external file instead of overwriting the model filesystem.
.br
By default, every virtual machine has its own \fICOW file\fR. Such file is
created in the current directory as soon as the virtual machine is first started. Its
name is the same as the name of the virtual machine plus the suffix ``.disk''.
For example, assuming the current directory is `/home/foo/', starting a new
virtual machine named ``pc1'' automatically creates the file `/home/foo/pc1.disk'.
.br
By passing a \fIFILESYSTEM\fR name it is possible to use a different COW file.
If \fIFILESYSTEM\fR is not found, a new file with this name is created. Otherwise,
\fIFILESYSTEM\fR must be the name of a COW file that has been previously created
by a virtual machine.
.br
Consider that COW files are never automatically removed after a machine has been
halted or crashed (unless proper options of \fBvhalt\fR or \fBvcrash\fR are being
used). This allows to preserve filesystem contents across reboots of the virtual
machine.

.PP
Both \fIMODEL\-FILESYSTEM\fR and \fIFILESYSTEM\fR must not contain commas (`\fB,\fR')
in their names.

Options \fB\-f\fR and \fB\-\-filesystem\fR cannot be used in conjunction with
\fB\-W\fR or \fB\-\-no\-cow\fR.

\fBNotice\fR: it is not possible to combine a \fICOW file\fR with different
\fImodel file\fRs. Hence, virtual machines must always be started with the
combination of \fImodel\fR and \fICOW file\fR used upon their first startup.

.B
*** IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT THE HOST MACHINE FILESYSTEM ***

In principle, there is no particular restriction on the choice of the filesystem
(of the host machine) on which \fIMODEL\-FILESYSTEM\fR and \fIFILESYSTEM\fR
are located. However, installing Netkit on a machine that uses a
non-standard Linux filesystem (e.g., FAT32) may introduce performance losses
and/or malfunctions. Please refer to the README file in the Netkit filesystem
package for more information about this.

.RE


.TP
.B
-W
.TP
.B
--no-cow
Instead of using two different files for storing filesystem data (as explained
above), write filesystem changes directly on the model filesystem.

\fINever start two virtual machines with the \fB\-W\fIq option\fR, or your
filesystem image may get corrupted!

This option cannot be used in conjunction with \fB\-f\fR, 
.nh
\fB\-\-filesystem\fR,
.hy
\fB\-D\fR, or
.nh
\fB\-\-hide\-disk\-file\fR.
.hy

\fBWarning\fR: by using this option, all the changes being made to the filesystem
of the virtual machine are made permanent. Do \fBnot\fR use this option unless
you know what you are doing!

.TP
.B
-D
.TP
.B
--hide-disk-file
By using this option, the ``.disk'' file of virtual machines is no longer created
(actually, it is deleted soon after it is created). This is useful if you do not
want to scatter temporary disk images around your filesystem. Using this option
does not compromise in any way the operation of virtual machines, except, of
course, that the contents of virtual machine filesystems are irremediably lost as
soon as the machines are stopped.

This option cannot be used in conjunction with \fB\-W\fR or
.nh
\fB\-\-no\-cow\fR.
.hy


.SS Console settings
.TP
.B
--con0=\fIMODE\fR
.TP
.B
--con1=\fIMODE\fR
Each virtual machine can have at most two console windows, which correspond to
the virtual terminals (ttys) of the real host. \fBcon0\fR is the primary console,
and \fBcon1\fR is an optional, secondary console. Depending on the value of
\fIMODE\fR, each console can be configured to be attached to different terminal
emulator programs or devices. \fIMODE\fR can be one of the following:

.RS
.PP
.TP
.B
xterm
Attach console to a terminal emulator application (the application must be
correctly installed).
.TP
.B
this
Attach console to stdin/stdout (i.e., use the current terminal); \fBthis\fR mode cannot
be used for both the primary and the secondary console at the same time.
.TP
.B
pty
Attach console to a pseudo-terminal. You can later reach it by connecting a
terminal emulator to the corresponding tty (for example, `screen /dev/ttyp0').
.TP
.B
port:\fItcp\-port\fR
Attach console to TCP port \fItcp\-port\fR. This console can then be accessed
by telnetting to that port. The virtual machine will not be actually started
until the first connection is established. Notice that, if the connection is closed
while the virtual machine is still running, it won't be possible to access the console
by telnetting again to \fItcp\-port\fR. In such a case, the virtual machine
can still be halted by using one of the commands \fBvhalt\fR or \fBvcrash\fR.
.TP
.B
none
Disable console (primary console cannot be disabled).

.LP
Default console settings (including the default terminal emulator application to
be used) are stored inside the \fInetkit.conf\fR configuration file (see
\fBnetkit.conf\fR(5)).

Using the \fB\-\-con0\fR=\fBthis\fR option also implies \fB\-\-foreground\fR.
.RE

.TP
.B
--xterm=\fITYPE\fR
Consoles enabled in \fBxterm\fR \fIMODE\fR can make use of different terminal
emulator applications. In particular, \fITYPE\fR can assume one of the following
values:

.RS
.PP
.TP
.B
gnome
use the Gnome Desktop gnome\-terminal.
.TP
.B
konsole
use the KDE Desktop Environment konsole.
.TP
.B
konsole-tab
same as \fBkonsole\fR, except different virtual machines are opened in different
tabs of the same konsole window.
.TP
.B
xterm
use the standard xterm.

.LP
When attaching a console to a terminal emulator, make sure that the corresponding
application is properly installed.
.br
The default terminal emulator application to be used is configured inside the
\fInetkit.conf\fR file (see \fBnetkit.conf\fR(5)).

  
.SS Laboratory settings
The following options can be used when setting up virtual laboratories. In general,
it is unlikely that you need to directly use them. Instead, laboratories should
be set up by using the \fBlstart\fR command (see \fBlstart\fR(1)).

.TP
.B
-e \fICOMMAND\fR
.TP
.B
--exec=\fICOMMAND\fR
Run a specific command inside the virtual machine during the boot phase.
\fICOMMAND\fR should be the name of an executable command or script.

.TP
.B
-l \fIDIRECTORY\fR
.TP
.B
--hostlab=\fIDIRECTORY\fR
Tell the virtual machine that the base directory for the laboratory is \fIDIRECTORY\fR.
\fIDIRECTORY\fR is a directory on the host machine which contains information
about the configuration of the laboratory.

.TP
.B
-w \fIDIRECTORY\fR
.TP
.B
--hostwd=\fIDIRECTORY\fR
Set the lab working directory to \fIDIRECTORY\fR. \fIDIRECTORY\fR is a directory
on the host machine which is used to store some temporary files (e.g., files
that indicate that a virtual machine has completed the boot process).

.PP
\fBNotice\fR: options \fB\-l\fR,
.nh
\fB\-\-hostlab\fR,
.hy
\fB\-w\fR, and
.nh
\fB\-\-hostwd\fR
.hy
make the host filesystem accessible inside the virtual machine even if the
option \fB\-H\fR or
.nh
\fB\-\-no\-hosthome\fR
.hy
is being used. In particular, \fIDIRECTORY\fR is made available for reading/writing
under the `/hostlab' or `/hostwd' directory in the virtual machine
(depending on the option being used).

.SS Other options
.TP
.B
--append=\fIPARAMETER\fR
Append additional kernel command line parameters when running the virtual machine
kernel. \fIPARAMETER\fR can be the name of a kernel option (e.g., ``quiet'') or
a pair \fIPARAMETER\fR=\fIVALUE\fR. Documentation about supported parameters can
be found inside the kernel source tree (which you can download at http://www.kernel.org).

This option can be used multiple times, so that several parameters can be appended.
Parameters will be passed to the kernel in the same order in which they are
provided.

.TP
.B
-F
.TP
.B
--foreground
By default, virtual machines are started in background. By using this option,
\fIvstart\fR waits for the virtual machine to halt (or crash) before giving
the command line prompt back. Virtual machines are also started in foreground
when using the \fB\-\-con0\fR=\fBthis\fR or \fB\-\-con1\fR=\fBthis\fR option.

Regardless of this option, virtual hubs are always started in background.

.TP
.B
-h
.TP
.B
--help
Show usage information. This option also prints out the default values for
several settings (i.e., those that have been configured inside \fInetkit.conf\fR
\(em see \fBnetkit.conf\fR(5)).

.TP
.B
-p
.TP
.B
--print
Instead of actually starting the virtual machine, just show which commands would
be executed, including those used to start virtual hubs.

.TP
.B
-q
.TP
.B
--quiet
Suppress any output except errors and warnings.

.TP
.B
-v
.TP
.B
--verbose
This option enables verbose kernel messages during the virtual machine boot phase.

.TP
.B
--version
Print information about the installed Netkit release and the host kernel version
and exit. If ``\fI<unavailable>\fR'' is printed instead of a version number,
then the corresponding information could not be retrieved (for example because
a non-standard Netkit kernel or filesystem is being used).

.SH FILES
.TP
.I
MACHINE-NAME.disk
This is the default \fICOW\fR filesystem used by virtual machines. This file
is automatically created in the current directory as soon as virtual machine
\fIMACHINE\-NAME\fR is started, if it does not exist yet. It stores all the
differences between the model filesystem and the current filesystem contents.

~/.netkit/netkit.conf
These files store global defaults for newly started virtual machines. They are
considered in the order in which they are listed, so that users can override
system wide settings. For more information about the contents of this file, see
\fBnetkit.conf\fR(5).
.TP
.I
~/.netkit/hubs/
This directory stores temporary socket files that are needed for the virtual hubs
to work properly. These files are automatically removed when unused. A different

\fBnetkit.conf\fR(5)).
.TP
.I
~/.netkit/mconsole/
This directory stores temporary socket files that are used to send special
directives to the virtual machines (e.g., halting commands). These files are
automatically removed when the corresponding virtual machine is halted or
crashed. A different directory may also be configured inside the \fInetkit.conf\fR
file (see \fBnetkit.conf\fR(5)).
