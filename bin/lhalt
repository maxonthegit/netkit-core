This command gracefully shuts down the virtual machines of a Netkit lab. Halting
instead of crashing is much slower but preserves virtual machines filesystem
integrity. Optionally, this command also deletes virtual machines filesystems.
Depending on the command line being used, it is possible to halt only a subset
of the virtual machines that make up the lab.
Available options are:

  -d DIRECTORY        Halt the lab inside DIRECTORY. By default, the lab in
                      the current directory is halted.
  -l, --list          Show a list of running virtual machines after halting
                      the lab.
  -q, --quick
      --quiet         Disable checking whether virtual machines have properly
                      shut down. This quickens the halt process, but no
                      warnings are raised if a virtual machine is unable to
                      shut down.
                      This option slightly reduces the amount of printed
                      information as well. It cannot be used together with -r.
  -r, --remove-fs     Delete virtual machines filesystems after halting them.
                      This never impacts the model filesystem. This option
                      cannot be used together with -q.

Other standard options are:

  -h, --help          Show this help.
      --version       Print version information and exit.

If one or more MACHINE-NAMEs are passed on the command line, then only those
machines will be halted (and their filesystems deleted, if asked to). If any
of the MACHINE-NAMEs is invalid (i.e., it does not correspond to a virtual
machine of the lab), it will simply be skipped.
